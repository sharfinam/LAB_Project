          <p class="content-body">
              Starting from nothing, players drop into the Hollow Lands to loot, increase in power, and defeat enemy players in order
              to become the ultimate battlemage.

              Run, jump, levitate, dash, fly and teleport around your opponents in order to decimate them with powerful Spells &
              Sorceries obtained from Gauntlets.

              Increase your stats and acquire new abilities as you pick up equipment found in Gauntlet Chest.png Chests throughout the
              Hollow Lands.

              As you traverse the land a trail will be left behind you when levitating, allowing other players to more easily spot
              your position.

              You will also find giant rifts in the ground caused by The Fracture, that will immediately exile any player unfortunate
              enough to fall in. Ending the match for them.

              Your goal will be to escape from the Spellstorm and either outlasting or exiling your opponents through combat until
              you're the last one standing.

          <h1>Classic - Battle Royale</h1>
          <p class="content-body">
          In this game mode, the player can queue as either solo, duo or squad (three players).

          If you queue as duo or squad, you also have a "fill" option, which allows others entering the lobby to fill up empty
          slots in your party.

          In solo queue, the player will immediately be exiled upon death, ending the match and dropping all their items and
          equipment in the process.

          In duo & squad queues, the player disrupts into a wisp upon death and starts fading away over 90 seconds.

          This allows them to be Resurrect Icon.png revived by a teammate after a 5 second channel, recovering 40 health.

          Should they fail to be revived in time, or if their remainding squad is disrupted as well, they will be exiled.

          They can also be Exile Icon.png exiled prematurely by an opponent following a 5 second channel. The channel will be
          interrupted upon any damage taken if the player is exiling, but not if reviving.

          Each game lobby can house a maximum of 42 players.

          <h1>Clash - Team Death Match</h1>
          <p class="content-body">
          In Clash two teams of up to 9 players are pitted against each other, in a race to be the first to reach the required
          score and win the game.

          This required score is equal to 3 times the total player count at match start. So for a full lobby of 18 players, the
          required score will be 54.

          Each exile will add one point to the total score of the opposing team.

          Upon being exiled, the player will drop all their equipment as usual, but the match will not end for them.

          Instead, after 8 seconds they will respawn and drop from a random portal within the current safe zone.

          They will spawn with full health and armor, duplicate equipment and 2 Small Armor Shard.png small armor shards in their
          inventory.

          However, one should expect to be exiled often as there is no LargeHP Consumable.png consumbles to be found anywhere on
          the map.

          In addition, equipment of Common rarity is removed from the loot tables of Gauntlet Chest.png Chests.

          Finally, the starting safe zone is much smaller in Clash as opposed to Classic, and the Spellstorm closes in faster.

          <h1>The Spellstorm</h1>
          <p class="content-body">
            As with most other battle royale games, one of the core game mechanics is an ever-shrinking safe zone that is marked by
            a circle on the map.

            Players must aim to stay inside the safe zone at all costs in order to survive.

            The safe zone will spawn 20 seconds after match start, and can appear anywhere on the Hollow Lands map.

            Outside the safe zone is a furious Spellstorm that deals 1 damage every 2 seconds directly to a player's health,
            bypassing armor.

            The damage doubles in power each time the Storm fully encloses a new safe zone, and it will continue to shrink until the
            entire map is covered.

            The player levels up each time they enter a new safe zone, unlocking the next Skill for their chosen Class.

            Additionally, Mana Vault.png Mana Vaults will spawn inside the safe zone each time the Storm fully encloses it.
